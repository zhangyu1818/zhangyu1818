### 你好👋, &nbsp;I'm ZHANGYU

I'm a frontend developer from Chengdu, with a love for writing `code`. I post blogs on [zhangyu.dev](https://www.zhangyu.dev/).

In my spare time, I learn `Swift` and make small apps. I'm using [Polyglot](https://github.com/liou666/polyglot) to level up my English, with the aim to work remotely in the future. 

I also like skateboarding and skiing 🏂, but I don't do risky tricks.
